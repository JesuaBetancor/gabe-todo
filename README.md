## TODO APP -> POKEDEX

- add a field called *ID*
- the current text input will be called *description*
- you need both fields to submit the form *(add validation)*
- if the form is submitted, you'll make a call to this API: https://pokeapi.co/
  example: https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/1
- with the data retrieve, instead of a todo component, show a card with the following information
  - *name* of the pokemon
  - *image* of the pokemon
  - *types* of the pokemon
  - the *ID* you introduced
  - the *description* you added in the form
    - All this information should   be available from the endpoint (example: https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/1)
      and the information you introduce in the form
